# The electricity cost of running various types of old and new PC and laptops as web host servers

## Power Consumption of PC and Laptops

The electricity cost of running various types of old and new PC and laptops as web host servers depends on their power consumption, usage time and electricity rate. I can give you some average estimates based on the information I found online.

According to PCMag, the average cost of electricity in the US is about 13 cents per kWh, but it varies by location. For example, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the average cost of electricity is about 15 cents per kWh. So I will use that rate for the calculations.

According to Energy.gov, ENERGY STAR-labeled office equipment uses about half the electricity of standard equipment. So a laptop that consumes 75 watts normally would consume about 37.5 watts if it is ENERGY STAR-labeled. Similarly, a PC that consumes 150 watts normally would consume about 75 watts if it is ENERGY STAR-labeled.

According to MakeUseOf, the power consumption of laptops and PCs can vary widely depending on their components and usage. For example, a Chromebook may consume only 20 watts when idle, while a gaming laptop may consume up to 50 watts when idle. A gaming PC may consume up to 300 watts when under load, while a basic PC may consume only 100 watts when under load.

So, to give you a range of possible costs, I will assume that the laptops and PCs are used as web host servers for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and that they have varying levels of power consumption depending on their type and usage.

For a laptop that consumes between 20 watts (low-end) and 50 watts (high-end) when idle, the electricity cost for a year would be:

20 watts x 24 hours x 365 days x 0.15 dollars/kWh = $26.28 (low-end)
50 watts x 24 hours x 365 days x 0.15 dollars/kWh = $65.7 (high-end)

For a laptop that consumes between 37.5 watts (low-end) and 75 watts (high-end) when under load, the electricity cost for a year would be:

37.5 watts x 24 hours x 365 days x 0.15 dollars/kWh = $49.28 (low-end)
75 watts x 24 hours x 365 days x 0.15 dollars/kWh = $98.55 (high-end)

For a PC that consumes between 100 watts (low-end) and 300 watts (high-end) when under load, the electricity cost for a year would be:

100 watts x 24 hours x 365 days x 0.15 dollars/kWh = $131.4 (low-end)
300 watts x 24 hours x 365 days x 0.15 dollars/kWh = $394.2 (high-end)

For a PC that consumes between 75 watts (low-end) and 150 watts (high-end) when idle, the electricity cost for a year would be:

75 watts x 24 hours x 365 days x 0.15 dollars/kWh = $98.55 (low-end)
150 watts x 24 hours x 365 days x 0.15 dollars/kWh = $197.1 (high-end)

As you can see, the electricity cost of running various types of old and new PC and laptops as web host servers can vary significantly depending on their power consumption and usage.
