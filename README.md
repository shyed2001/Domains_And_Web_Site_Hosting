WordPress.com is a website builder that allows you to create a site, sell your stuff, start a blog and more. It is the world's most popular website builder with 43% of the web built on WordPress¹. It offers dozens of free, customizable, mobile-ready designs and themes¹. You can also install 50,000+ plugins and themes, deploy custom code, multi-site management, SSH, WP-CLI, and Git tools¹. It also offers performance features such as global CDN with 28+ locations, highly scalable CPU bursting, lightning-fast high-frequency CPUs¹. It has security features such as real-time activity log, DDOS mitigation and firewall protection, isolated site environment¹.

You can create a free website or build a blog with ease on WordPress.com. You can also log in to your account via email address or username². WordPress.com takes your privacy seriously and uses cookies to collect some personal data from you (like your browsing data, IP addresses, and other unique identifiers)³.

The main difference between WordPress.com and WordPress.org is who’s actually hosting your website. WordPress.com is a hosted blogging service that takes care of all the technical aspects of your site for you (easier to start, less freedom). WordPress.org is a self-hosted option that allows you to download the WordPress software for free and install it on your own web host (more control, more responsibility)¹².

Some other differences are:

- WordPress.com offers various plans with different features and prices, while WordPress.org is free to download but you need to pay for your own hosting and domain².
- WordPress.com includes a wide range of themes and plugins, but you can only install custom ones on higher-tier plans. WordPress.org allows you to install any theme or plugin you want, but you need to manage them yourself²³.
- WordPress.com provides security, performance, and reliability features such as backups, SSL, CDN, firewall, etc. WordPress.org depends on your host and hosting package for these features².
- WordPress.com takes your privacy seriously and uses cookies to collect some personal data from you. WordPress.org does not collect any personal data from you, but your host or third-party plugins might³⁴.

There is no definitive answer to this question, as it depends on your goals, preferences, and budget. Some people may think that WordPress.com is better for beginners because it is easier to set up and maintain, and it offers a lot of features and support for a reasonable price. Others may think that WordPress.org is better for beginners because it gives you more freedom and flexibility, and it allows you to learn more about web development and WordPress. Ultimately, you should choose the option that suits your needs and expectations best.

To create a website on WordPress, you need to follow these steps:

- **Select a WordPress plan (WordPress.com only) or sign up for web hosting**. WordPress.com offers various plans with different features and prices, while WordPress.org is free to download but you need to pay for your own hosting and domain¹.
- **Set up your domain name and hosting provider**. A domain name is the address of your website on the internet, such as google.com or wordpress.com. A hosting provider is a service that stores your website files and makes them accessible to the web. You can choose from many hosting providers that offer WordPress hosting, such as Bluehost, SiteGround, DreamHost, etc².
- **Install WordPress**. Depending on your hosting provider, you may be able to install WordPress with a few clicks or you may need to follow some manual steps. WordPress.com users don't need to install WordPress, as it is already set up for them².
- **Choose your theme**. A theme is a collection of templates and stylesheets that define the appearance and layout of your website. You can choose from thousands of free and premium themes available on WordPress.org or WordPress.com, or you can install a custom theme from another source²³.
- **Add posts and pages to your website**. Posts and pages are the main content types in WordPress. Posts are typically used for blog articles, news updates, or other timely content. Pages are typically used for static content, such as about, contact, or services pages. You can add posts and pages from your WordPress dashboard using the Block Editor, which allows you to create and edit content with drag-and-drop simplicity²⁴.
- **Customize your website**. You can customize your website using various options in the WordPress dashboard, such as changing the site title, logo, colors, fonts, menus, widgets, background, header, footer, etc. You can also use the Customizer tool to preview and adjust your site's appearance in real time²⁴.
- **Install plugins**. Plugins are extensions that add new features and functionality to your website. You can install plugins from the WordPress Plugin Directory or from other sources. Plugins can help you with security, performance, SEO, social media, eCommerce, forms, analytics, and more²⁴.
- **Optimize your website to increase page speed**. Page speed is an important factor for user experience and SEO. You can optimize your website by using caching plugins, image optimization plugins, minifying CSS and JavaScript files, reducing HTTP requests, enabling compression, and more¹.

Yes, you can add HTML, CSS, JS and PHP to your WordPress website. There are different ways to do this, depending on what you want to achieve. Here are some options:

- **Use the Custom HTML block**: If you want to add some HTML and CSS code to a specific page or post, you can use the Custom HTML block in the WordPress editor. Just click on the plus sign button next to the Widgets heading and select the Custom HTML block. Add the code you want within the block and move it around to change its placement. When you’re done, click on the Update button in the top-right corner of the screen¹.
- **Create a Child Theme**: If you want to add your own HTML, CSS or JavaScript code to your entire website, you can create a child theme that inherits the features and styles of your parent theme, but allows you to customize them without losing your changes when you update the parent theme. You can create a child theme manually or use a plugin like Child Theme Configurator². To add PHP code to your child theme, you can use the functions.php file or create custom template files.
- **Use a Plugin**: If you want to add custom CSS or JavaScript code to your website without creating a child theme, you can use a plugin like Simple Custom CSS and JS² or Code Snippets². These plugins let you add code snippets to your website without editing your theme files. They also have options to run the code on specific pages or posts, or on the entire website.

Yes, you can also link external pages and databases to your WordPress website. Here are some ways to do that:

- **Use the Page Links To plugin**: If you want to link a post or page on your WordPress site to an external URL, you can use the Page Links To plugin. This plugin lets you redirect any post or page to any URL you want. To use the plugin, you need to install and activate it from the Plugins -> Add New menu. Then, create a new post or page or edit an existing one. Scroll down to the Page Links To tab and choose A Custom URL radio button. Enter the URL you want to link to and choose if you want to open it in a new tab. Update or publish your post or page and it will link to the external URL¹.
- **Use the Advanced iFrame plugin**: If you want to embed an external web page in your WordPress site, you can use the Advanced iFrame plugin. This plugin lets you use an iframe to display content from another website in WordPress. To use the plugin, you need to install and activate it from the Plugins -> Add New menu. Then, create a new page or edit an existing one. Click on the Advanced iFrame button in the editor toolbar and enter the URL of the external web page you want to embed. You can also adjust other settings like width, height, scrolling, etc. Insert the shortcode and update or publish your page. It will display the external web page in an iframe².
- **Use the WPDB class**: If you want to connect to an external database from your WordPress site, you can use the WPDB class. This is a PHP class that WordPress uses to interact with its own database, but you can also use it to connect to another database. To use the WPDB class, you need to create an instance of it with the database credentials (host, user, password, name) of the external database. Then, you can use various methods of the WPDB class to query, insert, update, or delete data from the external database³.

To connect to a remote database from WordPress, you need to do the following steps:

- **Enable remote access to the database server**: You need to configure the database server to allow remote connections from the web server. You can do this by editing the database configuration file (usually /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf) and changing the bind-address parameter to the web server's IP address or 0.0.0.0 for all interfaces. You also need to open the database port (usually 3306) on the firewall of the database server¹².
- **Create a database and a user for WordPress**: You need to create a database and a user for WordPress on the remote database server. You can do this by logging in to the database server as root and running some SQL commands. For example, you can create a database named wordpress, a user named wpuser with password password, and grant all privileges to the user on the database¹². You can also specify the web server's IP address in the user creation command to restrict access from that IP only.
- **Edit the wp-config.php file**: You need to edit the wp-config.php file on the web server to tell WordPress to use the remote database. You can do this by changing the DB_HOST parameter to the IP address or domain name of the database server. You also need to change the DB_NAME, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD parameters to match the ones you created on the database server¹²³.
- **Test the connection**: You can test the connection by visiting your WordPress site and checking if it works properly. If you encounter any errors, you can troubleshoot them by checking the logs, firewall rules, or database settings.

Yes, WordPress.com provides free hosting for your website. You can create a free website with a WordPress.com subdomain, powerful website hosting, dozens of free themes, and unlimited pages and users¹. However, there are some limitations and trade-offs with the free plan, such as:

- You have to use a WordPress.com subdomain (e.g. yoursite.wordpress.com) and cannot use your own custom domain name (e.g. yoursite.com).
- You have to display WordPress.com ads on your site and cannot monetize your site with your own ads.
- You have limited storage space (1 GB) and cannot upload videos or audio files.
- You have limited customization options and cannot install plugins or themes that are not available on WordPress.com.
- You have to pay a 10% transaction fee for payments, donations, and tips on your site.

If you want more features and flexibility, you can upgrade to a paid plan that suits your needs. WordPress.com offers several plans ranging from $4 to $45 per month (billed annually) that include different benefits such as:

- A free custom domain name for one year
- More storage space (up to 200 GB)
- No WordPress.com ads and the ability to run your own ads
- Video and audio uploads
- Advanced customization options and access to thousands of plugins and themes
- No transaction fees for payments, donations, and tips
- Premium support and security features
